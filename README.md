#Tic Tac Toe
This repository is for a Tic Tac Toe/Noughts and Crosses game made in C using the minimax function for AI. 

Required features:

Map -- Done
Check win functions -- Done 
Player interaction -- Done
AI - Minmax and AlphaBeta -- Done except for Alpha-Beta

Must account for any and all corner cases, AI must be a "perfect" AI in the sense it will either win or draw - not lose. -- Done
Must be well commented. -- Subjective, could do with more. 

Desired feaures:

GUI - Potential library: GTK+
    When implementing a GUI, a new file will be created to showcase both the ASCII terminal version as well as the GUI version.
