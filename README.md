#Tic Tac Toe
This repository is for a Tic Tac Toe/Noughts and Crosses game made in C using a depth first search for AI. 

Required features:

Map -- Done
Check win functions -- Done 
Player interaction -- Done
AI - Depth First and AlphaBeta -- Done to an extent. Pruning has been implemented but not exactly alpha-beta. 

Must account for any and all corner cases, AI must be a "perfect" AI in the sense it will either win or draw - not lose (reasonably). -- Done
Must be well commented. -- Subjective, could do with more. 

Desired feaures:

GUI -- Done. See TicUI.c, requires GTK+3.0 and to be compiled with this library. 
    When implementing a GUI, a new file will be created to showcase both the ASCII terminal version as well as the GUI version.
